    <h4>What is Three-Factor Model?</h4>
    <div>
      <li>The Fama French 3-factor model is an asset pricing model that expands on the capital asset pricing model by adding size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factors.</li>
      <li>This model considers the fact that value and small-cap stocks outperform markets on a regular basis.</li>
      <li> Since preferred stockholders have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common shareholders, 
          preferred equity is subtracted from shareholderâ€™s equity to derive the equity available to common shareholders.</li>
    <li> The model is essentially the result of an econometric regression of historical stock prices.</li>
